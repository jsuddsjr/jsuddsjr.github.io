      "Quiet but nice weather conditions are expected in Southern Idaho for the last weekend of November. Temperatures are expected to climb back to near average values for the region, which means lower 40s for the Magic Valley and Mini-Cassia Region, and middle 30s for the Wood River Valley. Partly cloudy to sunny skies are in the forecast as well, so there shouldn’t be a big issue when it comes to cloud coverage this weekend, either!",
      "A cold front is expected to move through Southern Idaho overnight Monday into Tuesday, which means that temperatures are going to fall a little bit for the first day of December. I anticipate high temps dropping by about 10° in the Magic Valley and Mini-Cassia Region from Monday to Tuesday, while the Wood River Valley will drop a few degrees. There will also be a few showers around overnight Monday into Tuesday, but it should not be a big weather-maker for the region. This is the best chance of showers over the next week, and as a matter of fact, it is the only chance of showers over the next seven days. A little bit of a breeze may also develop overnight Monday into Tuesday, which will probably be the breeziest duration of time through the next week."
