      <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
      <img src="images/scoots-logo.webp" alt="Scoots logo" />
      <p>
        ~Scoots is a fictitious motor scooter rental company located on the
        island of Cozumel off the coast of Mexico in the western Caribbean Sea.
        This owner-operator company caters to locals, walk-in tourists,
        enthusiasts, and cruise-based touring groups and partnerships. The
        company promotes friendly and easy to rent services of motor scooters,
        jeeps, and side-by-sides ATVs.

      <p>
        The company has two physical rental locations on Cozumel. One is near
        the Playa del Carmen-Cozumel Ferry dock in el Centro de Cozumel and the
        other is near the Terminal Puerta Maya further south along the coast
        which caters to the cruise lines and patrons.

      <h2>Target Audience</h2>
      <p>
        The overall goal of the website project is to promote the rental
        services for those customers that like to do their homework before
        getting to the island and to provide
        <a href="#"
          >information about the services, requirements, and rental process</a
        >. The website should reflect the fun and carefree attitude of the
        island and the ability to escape the touristy western part of the island
        by exploring the vast coasts and inlets on the southern and eastern
        shores.
