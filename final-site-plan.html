      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        It's a site for custom yarn products and the projects you can make with
        them. You will browse colorful, exclusive, hand-made scarves and
        blankets, along with knitting and spinning advice. The knitting projects
        will be emphasized, as they fuel the demand for knitting supplies. Each
        project will have a description, detailed pattern, and instructional
        video. The site can expand to include consignment sales, knitter's
        corner forum, or newsletter as time allows.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The site caters to the "yarn artist," the people who are devoted to
        making yarn creations that inspire and who want to share their creations
        and their know-how with the world.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Anyone who knits, crochets, makes yarn, or makes things with yarn
        </li>
        <li>Anyone who would like to learn about this age-old craft</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>

        of a knitting project.

      <h2>Style Guide</h2>
      <h3>Color Palette</h3>
      <p>
        At first, I envisioned a vibrant color pallette with six colors;
        however, subsequent tests show that the website looks better with clean,
        but subdued colors, which allow the knitting projects to add additional
        color to the site.
      </p>
      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">hsla(200, 73%, 28%, 1)</td>
          <td class="secondary">white</td>
          <td class="accent1">hsla(26, 35%, 27%, 1)</td>
          <td class="accent2">hsla(24, 31%, 58%, 1)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Typography</h3>
      <h4>Heading Font: Gochi Hand</h4>
      <p>
        A hand-written look gives this font its friendly demeanor.
      </p>
      <h4>Paragraph Font: Poppins</h4>
      <p>This font is easy to read and complements the heading font well.</p>
      <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>Colored paragraph example</h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
