      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        It's a site for custom yarn products and the projects you can make with
        them. You will browse colorful, exclusive, hand-made scarves and
        blankets, along with knitting and spinning advice. The knitting projects
        will be emphasized, as they fuel the demand for knitting supplies. Each
        project will have a description, detailed pattern, and instructional
        video. The site can expand to include consignment sales, knitter's
        corner forum, or newsletter as time allows.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The site caters to the "yarn artist," the people who are devoted to
        making yarn creations that inspire and who want to share their creations
        and their know-how with the world.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Anyone who knits, crochets, makes yarn, or makes things with yarn
        </li>
        <li>Anyone who would like to learn about this age-old craft</li>
      </ul>
