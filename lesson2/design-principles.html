        <h2>Proximity</h2>
        <p class="company">
          Bing:
          <a href="https://bing.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >bing.com</a
          >
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/bing-search.png" alt="Mobile view" /></p>
        <p>
          Elements of the page are grouped together to show relationships. The
          Bing logo is closer to the search box to create a strong visual
          connection. The tools inside the search box are also grouped together.
          The tools menu is placed further away in the upper right-hand corner
          to create space; they are nearby but serve a peripheral function. The
          news story at the bottom of the page is just visible, as news is not
          the primary purpose of the page.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Whitespace</h2>
        <p class="company">
          Microsoft Store:
          <a
            href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/surface-deals"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
            >microsoft.com</a
          >
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/microsoft-store.png" alt="Mobile view" /></p>
        <p>
          Good use of negative space to help separate elements and give the page
          a light, airy feeling. The Microsoft log in the top menu bar creates a
          center of gravity for the design, and the icons on either side of it
          have a clear purpose. The remainder of the page is organized as a list
          of selling points, each separated from the others into its own
          section.
        </p>

        <h2>Repetition</h2>
        <p class="company">
          Xbox Official Site:
          <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"
            >xbox.com</a
          >
        </p>
        <p><img src="images/xbox-repetition.png" alt="Mobile view" /></p>
        <p>
          The Xbox store repeats the same elements that appear elsewhere on the
          Microsoft websites, but adds a few custom elements of its own. Here we
          see a collection of icons that have been designed around the same
          visual design: line drawings with minimal detail in a common shade of
          green. Below them is an ad that expertly uses repetition to create a
          common sense of purpose: encouraging young people to identify as
          voters in additional to all the other ways they might see themselves.
