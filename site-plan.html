      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD
        that builds and manages specialized hotel accommodations near temple
        locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around the
        world. The overall goal of the website project is to promote and provide
        information about the specialized services that this hotel chain offers.
        The website should reflect the Church culture and be designed to support
        a temple oriented theme as well as the concept of being a haven of
        comfort and accessibility.
      </p>
      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The owner-operated company caters to temple workers, patrons, and their
        families by providing specialized services and accommodations that meet
        the needs of guests both young and old. The site must be easy to navigate
        and accessible to those with low vision. Temple Inn guests will include:
        <ul>
          <li>Members of the church of all ages</li>
          <li>Physically active families with small children</li>
          <li>Newly married couples</li>
          <li>Older guests with reduced mobility</li>
          <li>Church missionaries and employees</li>
          <li>Non-members who know little about the church or temples</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <p>
        <img
          src="images/TempleInnLogo.png"
          alt="Temple Inn & Suites logo"
          height="200"
        />
        <img
        src="images/TempleInnLogo.png"
        alt="Temple Inn & Suites logo"
        height="100"
      />
      </p>
      <p>
        The image includes a sun stone design from the original Nauvoo temple, a
        symbol instantly recognized by members of the church. The logo's
        friendly design welcomes guests and reminds them of good mornings ahead.
        The large ampersand (&) hints at the specialized amenities that are
        included with their stay.
